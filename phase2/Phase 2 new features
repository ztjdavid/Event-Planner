New Features

1.Enhance the user's messaging experience by allowing them to "mark as unread", delete, or archive messages after reading them.

2.Allow the system to support additional user requests (e.g. dietary restrictions, accessibility requirements) where organizers
can tag a request as "pending" or "addressed". All organizers see the same list of requests, so if one tags a request as
addressed, all other organizers can log in and see that.

3.Use a database to store the information from your program through specific gateway class(es) so that you do not violate
Clean Architecture and still have an Entity layer.

4.Vip System

5.Attendees and Vips are able to apply to be a speaker.

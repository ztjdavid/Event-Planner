No one can message to an organizer except the case that a user is replying to a message
that a organizer sent out. In this case, an organizer can read this message in option 5
in the message dashboard and choose to mark as unread, delete or archive like the other users.
To reply to this message, organizer need to remember the ID of the message they want to reply by
reading the message in option 5 and enter the message ID in option 6.

############# Program Introduction ############

This program is a design of conference system which allow users to do several operations.
We have four kinds of users: Organizer, Speaker, Attendee, and vip
Each type of user will login to their own system and only allowed to do operations depend on their type.

Organizer are allowed to access to message system, create speaker account, schedule a event, and create room.
They are able to message all the attendees and speakers, at once or individually.

Speakers are allowed to read the information of events that they will present(like time, room, etc) and access to messaging system.
They are able to message all the attendees who attend their own talks, at once or individually.They are also able to reply message from
 organizer but cannot initiate conversation with organizers.

Attendees are allowed to read information about the event they registered, sign up anc cancel registration for new event, and also access to messaging system.
They are able to message to other attendees and the speakers of the talks they registered. They are also able to reply message from
organizer but cannot initiate conversation with organizers.

Vip will do the exactly same thing as attendee. The difference is they can also access to vip-only events.
